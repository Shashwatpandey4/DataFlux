# Major Refactoring and Docker Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure Refactoring
- Moved all code into `src/` directory for better organization
- Created proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Updated all import paths to reflect new structure
- Moved tests into dedicated `tests/` directory

### 2. Sink Implementation
- Implemented pluggable sink architecture with `BaseSink` interface
- Added three sink implementations:
  - `KafkaSink`: For Kafka event streaming
  - `FastAPISink`: For HTTP endpoint integration
  - `MockSink`: For testing and development
- Created `SinkFactory` for sink instantiation and management

### 3. Docker Implementation
- Added `Dockerfile` for containerization
- Created `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration
- Added `.dockerignore` for optimization
- Configured Kafka and Zookeeper services
- Exposed Prometheus metrics port (9100)

### 4. Documentation
- Rewrote README with:
  - Project overview and features
  - Architecture diagram
  - Quick start guide
  - Configuration examples
  - Development setup
  - Contribution guidelines

### 5. Metrics and Monitoring
- Implemented Prometheus metrics exporter
- Added metrics for:
  - Sink success/failure counts
  - Flush latencies
  - Event counts

## Issues Closed
Closes #1 - Kafka Sink Support
Closes #2 - FastAPI Sink Integration
Closes #3 - Docker Support + Compose Setup
Closes #8 - Expose Prometheus Metrics

## Testing
- Added test for Kafka sink
- Verified Docker setup with Kafka integration
- Tested metrics endpoint

## Next Steps
- Implement CLI runner (#4)
- Add distributed emitter support (#5)
- Complete modular transport layer (#6)
- Add emitter behavior profiles (#7)

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible with existing configurations.

## Documentation
- Updated README with new setup instructions
- Added Docker usage guide
- Documented sink configuration options

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Documentation updated
